# Bank Simulation System

The **Bank Simulation System** is a Python project designed to simulate the operations of a bank. It utilizes various Python modules such as `math` for arithmetic calculations, `random` for generating unique account numbers, and `datetime` for auditing logs of withdrawals and credits. This system provides a user-friendly interface for opening accounts, checking account details, withdrawing money, crediting money, and even closing accounts. Additionally, a bank manager can use the system to access information about all bank account users.

## Features

   - Users can open an account with a programmatically generated unique account number.
   - Provide personal details such as name, initial deposit, and contact information.

2. **Check Bank Account Details**:
   - Users can check their bank account details, including the account number, balance, and transaction history.

3. **Withdraw Money**:
   - Perform withdrawals from your bank account.
   - The system records the transaction in the transaction history.

4. **Credit Money**:
